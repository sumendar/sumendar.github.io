# About me

I am a data analyst with experience in gathering, organizing, aggregating, transforming, summarising, analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing data to find hidden patterns and trends. I can build, train, and evaluate predictive models or group unlabeled entities using Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Talend, Trifacta, and OpenRefine in addition to basic familiarity with cloud platforms and big data analytical frameworks to identify critical business issues and make strategic data-driven decisions based on actionable insights.

I am currently pursuing a post-graduate degree in data science, and I have bachelor’s and master’s degrees in STEM disciplines with quantitative specializations in mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

My specialties include but are not limited to data acquisition, preprocessing, data cleansing, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualizations, and machine learning.

Please connect with me about any of your data science and analytical needs so we can discuss how I can help you and your team.
