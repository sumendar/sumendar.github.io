## dplyr - Data Mainpulation Package

### Intorduction
Most of the data scientists spend 80% of their time on data preparation for a given project also known as wrangling or cleaning or simply we can say data manipulations, so `dplyr` is one of the most popular package which can help R users to solve on preparing or manipulating the dataset before going for actual analysis or modeling. some of those operations such as **selecting required columns, adding a new column, filtering  required observations, or even some of the tasks like sorting or aggregating**    

`dplyr` has couple of functions like  

`select()`  
`filter()`  
`mutate()`  
`arrange()`   
`summarize()`  

and 
**%>% operator**

## Install required packages
```{r include=FALSE}
ipak <- function(pkg){
    new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])]
    if (length(new.pkg)) 
        install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org", dependencies = TRUE)
    sapply(pkg, require, character.only = TRUE)
}

# usage
packages <- c("ggplot2", "dplyr")
ipak(packages)
```

### load the packages
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

### loading and examine the dataset
```{r cache=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
#for illustration purpose take the diamonds dataset from ggplot2 package and attached to this session
data(diamonds)
#examin first 6 observations
head(diamonds)
#take help from r documentation
#?diamonds
#examine the data
dim(diamonds)
str(diamonds)
summary(diamonds)
```
### select()
Select perticular interested columns from the dataset
```{r}
# select only the variables carat, color and price
select(diamonds, carat, color, price)
```

### filter()
filter acts like subsetting the data based on certain conditions
```{r}
# examine the factors in cut variable
table(diamonds$cut)
# subsetting or filtering the diamonds dataset where cut==”Premium”
filter(diamonds, cut=="Premium")
```
### mutate()
Mutate function is generally used to add variables to our dataset
```{r}
diamondsNew<- mutate(diamonds, pricePerCarat = price/carat)
#examine the new dataset whether new variable is added or not
head(diamondsNew)
names(diamondsNew)
```

### arrange()
this function is used to sort or ordering the data
```{r}
# first we will see the first 6 diamonds price in our dataset
head(diamonds$depth)
# then we can use arrange function on top of this vector of first six observationds of depth variable
head(arrange(diamonds,depth))
# the above output is basically shows in ascending order
# you can use desc() function inside arrange to make descending the data
head(arrange(diamonds,desc(depth)))
```

### summarize()
This function is used to get the summary statistics of the data
**its very powerfull when we use this function with the combination of `groupby`**
```{r}
#to get the average of price variable
summarize(diamonds, avgPrice = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE) )
#combination of summarize/summarise with group_by
summarise(group_by(diamonds, cut), mean=mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
summarize(group_by(diamonds, cut), mean=mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### %>% operator
The actual power of dplyr package lies in the usage of pipe operator (%>%), its very usefull when ever we required a chain of operations(series of activities) to work on one after another or using one command's result as input for another command   
```{r}
#Now we will use those above functions filter select and mutate and combine them into one and get the result by using %>% operator  
# filter(diamonds, cut=="Premium")
#select(diamonds, carat, color, price)
# diamondsNew<- mutate(diamonds, pricePerCarat = price/carat)


diamondsPipe <- diamonds %>% filter(cut=="Premium") %>% select(carat, color, price) %>% mutate(pricePerCarat = price/carat)
head(diamondsPipe)
```


## ggplot2 - Data Visualization Package
R is one of the most powerfull language for visualizations with minimal lines of code `ggplot2` is one of the package which can help the analysts to visualising the data by simple plotting to advanced visualisations

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  filter(cut == "Ideal") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=color,y=price)) + 
geom_boxplot()     
     
```

```{r}
head(iris)     
     
```
