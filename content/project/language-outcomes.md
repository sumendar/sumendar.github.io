Improving spoken language use (i.e., discourse skills) is a common treatment goal for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly for those with difficulties in conversational reciprocity, perseverative speech, or idiosyncratic/stereotyped word use. These features are clinically meaningful, and in previous projects, we have successfully applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to measure these discourse skills using natural language samples from children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, while NLP methods yield diagnostically relevant measures, it is not known if they can be translated into meaningful outcome measures. To take this next step, important questions must be addressed: 

* How stable and responsive are NLP discourse measures over time? 
* How consistent are the measures across different measurement contexts and lengths? 
* What is their validity? 
* To what degree are measures impacted by general language or intellectual abilities? 

Lack of knowledge about these psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures is a problem because, without it, the likelihood that children’s use of spoken language can be targeted and impacted in large-scale clinical trials is remote.

The long-term goal of this project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The parent project (R01DC012033: “Computational Characterization of Language Use in Autism Spectrum Disorder”) took the first steps towards this goal by developing NLP algorithms to measure discourse skills based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts. Our strong results indicate difficulties in conversational reciprocity as well as elevated repetitive language behaviors among children with ASD compared to children without ASD, and were not due to differences in age, IQ, or language abilities. Our objective in this project is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP automated discourse measures (ADMs) as outcomes for individuals with a range of intellectual abilities and diagnoses. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and sample lengths, and validity.
